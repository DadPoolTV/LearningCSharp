# Changes to Files
Listed below are the "revisions" that I have attempted to name to keep track of what I am changing as I go forward learning C#
# v1.0
This was the intial upload of the file after I played around with some of the lesson points from CodeAcademy

# v1.01
Added in a line and tested in GitHub options "Commit All and Push"
This changed the files here

# v1.02
Added in a comment line at the end of Program.cs and tested in GitHub options "Commit All" and then went to GitHub option Sync and hit "Outgoing Commits -> Push"
This changed the files here as well. My understanding is that it first saved it to my local repo, then Pushed those changes to the GitHub Repo
